<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Peritoneal Dialysis(APD) Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Type</li><li>Gravity Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) machines are categorized into two main types based on their operating mechanism: power-type and gravity-type. Power-type APD machines utilize electricity to automate the process of fluid exchange, allowing precise control over the dialysis cycles, volume, and timing. In contrast, gravity-type APD machines rely on gravitational force to facilitate the flow of the dialysis solution, offering a simpler and often more cost-effective option, but with less control over the exchange process. Both types aim to enhance patient convenience and treatment efficiency.</p></p>
